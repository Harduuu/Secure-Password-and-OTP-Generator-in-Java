# Secure-Password-and-OTP-Generator-in-Java
Built a Java tool to generate strong, random passwords and numeric OTPs using SecureRandom, ensuring secure and customizable authentication credentials. Focused on modular design and cryptographic safety.  Tech: Java, OOP, SecureRandom, CLI

Objective:

To develop a Java-based application that securely generates:
* Strong, random passwords
* One-Time Passwords (OTP) for authentication

Features:
* Generates secure passwords using uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.
* Generates numeric OTPs of customizable length.
* Simple CLI-based user interaction.
* Modular, reusable methods.

Technologies Used:
* Java (JDK 8+)
* No external libraries (just java.util)

Project Structure:
* PasswordGenerator.java: Generates strong, random passwords.
* OTPGenerator.java: Generates numeric OTPs.
* Main.java: Runs and tests both generators.
